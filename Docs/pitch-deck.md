# 🧠 DeSciBase — Decentralized Science Chainlet

**DeSciBase** is a decentralized publishing protocol for scientific research, powered by blockchain, IPFS, and its own modular appchain built with Saga.  
Researchers can publish, share, and monetize their work in a censorship-resistant, community-governed ecosystem using $DSB and DAO logic.

---

## 🔹 Vision

To create an open and verifiable repository of scientific knowledge, free from centralized control — governed transparently by its own chainlet logic and token incentives.

---

## 🚀 Problem

Traditional scientific publishing is:

* Expensive and centralized  
* Opaque and slow  
* Controlled by legacy institutions  
* Lacks transparency and incentives for authors

---

## ✅ Solution

DeSciBase solves this via:

* IPFS-based research storage and CAR file archiving  
* Native chainlet with modules for token, reputation, and DAO  
* On-chain publication tracking and governance  
* Reputation system for contributors and peer reviewers  
* $DSB token used for actions, curation, and voting

---

## ⚛️ Chainlet Migration

DeSciBase is building its own Saga chainlet:

* Custom Cosmos-SDK runtime with modular governance  
* desciToken (staking + utility)  
* Reputation module (non-transferable scoring)  
* DAO module with weighted voting  
* IPFS module for CAR file hash registration

## 🪙 Tokenomics ($DSB)

| Category            | %   | Tokens     |
| ------------------- | --- | ---------- |
| DAO Treasury        | 40% | 40,000,000 |
| Ecosystem & Users   | 25% | 25,000,000 |
| Team                | 15% | 15,000,000 |
| Grants & Partners   | 10% | 10,000,000 |
| Liquidity & Staking | 10% | 10,000,000 |

Uses:

* Publish papers (~10 $DSB per upload)  
* Vote in DAO proposals and chain upgrades  
* Earn via curation, moderation, and reviews  
* Reputation-weighted access and privileges

---

## 🧠 DAO Strategy

* Voting via on-chain DAO module (Saga chainlet)  
* Weighted governance (DSB + reputation score)  
* NFT badge or token threshold for proposal rights  
* Treasury managed by DAO via native logic

---

## 📊 Market

Scientific publishing is a $30B+ global industry:

* PhDs, universities, indie researchers seek open access  
* DAO-curated, IPFS-native platforms offer transparency  
* Ideal for on-chain incentives and modular governance

---

## 🧪 MVP Features

* IPFS CAR archive generator  
* Submit papers with reputation metadata  
* DAO proposal voting (native module)  
* User dashboard: profile, papers, votes  
* Chainlet integration status + node sync

---
