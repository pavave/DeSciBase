# 🧠 DeSciBase

**DeSciBase** is a decentralized science publishing protocol that empowers researchers to publish, share, and monetize their work via blockchain and IPFS — governed by the community through \$DSB and DAO.

---

## 🔹 Vision

To create an open, censorship-resistant and decentralized repository of scientific knowledge, free from gatekeepers, powered by token incentives and democratic governance.

---

## 🚀 Problem

Traditional scientific publishing is:

* Expensive and centralized
* Opaque and slow
* Difficult to access for the global public

---

## ✅ Solution

A decentralized protocol where:

* Researchers upload papers via IPFS
* Pay small fee in \$DSB to publish
* Community curates and rewards content via likes and comments
* All content is public, immutable and reputation-based

---

## 🪙 Tokenomics (\$DSB)

| Category            | %   | Tokens     |
| ------------------- | --- | ---------- |
| DAO Treasury        | 40% | 40,000,000 |
| Ecosystem & Users   | 25% | 25,000,000 |
| Team                | 15% | 15,000,000 |
| Grants & Partners   | 10% | 10,000,000 |
| Liquidity & Staking | 10% | 10,000,000 |

Uses:

* Publish research (10 \$DSB per paper)
* Vote in DAO
* Unlock premium access
* Earn via engagement and curation

---

## 🧠 DAO Strategy

* Governance through \$DSB token
* On-chain or Snapshot voting
* Proposals require 10k DSB or NFT badge
* DAO manages treasury and early grants to authors

---

## 📊 Market

DeSci and decentralized knowledge protocols are growing:

* \$30B+/year academic publishing industry
* PhDs, students, indie researchers need alternatives
* Ideal for DAO and token-based incentive models

---

## 🧪 MVP Features

* Submit papers (IPFS + contract)
* Like/vote (on-chain or signed)
* Personal profile (My Works, My Likes)
* Community feed (New, Top, Most Liked)
* Wallet login + \$DSB payment system

---

## 💡 Roadmap (Q3–Q4 2025)

* ✅ MVP: IPFS + frontend + contract (Q3)
* 🔄 DAO: Launch \$DSB + voting system (Q4)
* 🌐 Community: Author onboarding & grant pool
* 📱 Mobile dApp & decentralized identity (Q4–Q1)

---

## 🤩 Tech Stack

* IPFS / Web3.Storage
* Solidity / Pharos Chain
* React + Tailwind (frontend)
* DAO via Snapshot or on-chain module
* \$DSB ERC-20 token
