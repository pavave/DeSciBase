# 🧠 DeSciBase — Decentralized Science Chainlet (Legacy) and EVM Migration

**DeSciBase** is a decentralized publishing protocol for scientific research, originally powered by Saga — a modular appchain built on Cosmos SDK.  
Currently, DeSciBase is migrating to Ethereum-compatible smart contracts deployed on the Holesky testnet, while the Saga implementation is archived for future reference.

---

## 🔹 Vision

To build an open, verifiable repository of scientific knowledge, free from centralized control — transparently governed by its native chainlet logic and token incentives.

---

## 🚀 Problem

Traditional scientific publishing is:

- Expensive and centralized  
- Opaque and slow  
- Controlled by legacy institutions  
- Lacking transparency and incentives for authors

---

## ✅ Solution

DeSciBase addresses these challenges by providing:

- IPFS-based research storage and CAR file archiving  
- A native Saga chainlet (archived) with modules for tokenomics, reputation, and DAO governance  
- Solidity-based smart contracts deployed on EVM-compatible Holesky testnet  
- On-chain publication tracking and community governance  
- Reputation system rewarding contributors and peer reviewers  
- The $DSB token for platform actions, curation, and voting

---

## ⚛️ Saga Chainlet (Archived)

The original implementation included:

- Custom Cosmos SDK runtime with modular governance  
- `desciToken` module (staking and utility)  
- Reputation module (non-transferable scoring)  
- DAO module with weighted voting mechanisms  
- IPFS module for registering CAR file hashes

This Saga chainlet codebase is **archived** in the [`saga-legacy`](https://github.com/pavave/DeSciBase/tree/saga-legacy) branch.

## 🪙 Tokenomics ($DSB)

| Category            | %   | Tokens     |
| ------------------- | --- | ---------- |
| DAO Treasury        | 40% | 40,000,000 |
| Ecosystem & Users   | 25% | 25,000,000 |
| Team                | 15% | 15,000,000 |
| Grants & Partners   | 10% | 10,000,000 |
| Liquidity & Staking | 10% | 10,000,000 |

Token utility includes:

- Publishing papers (~10 $DSB per upload)  
- Voting in DAO proposals and chain upgrades  
- Earning rewards through curation, moderation, and peer reviews  
- Reputation-weighted access and privileges

---

## 🧠 DAO Strategy

- Governance via an on-chain DAO module on the Saga chainlet (archived)  
- Weighted voting based on $DSB holdings and reputation scores  
- NFT badges or token thresholds required for proposal creation  
- DAO treasury management through native chainlet logic

---

## 📊 Market

Scientific publishing is a $30B+ global industry:

- PhDs, universities, and independent researchers seek open access solutions  
- DAO-curated, IPFS-native platforms provide transparency and decentralization  
- The sector is ideal for on-chain incentives and modular governance frameworks

---

## 🧪 MVP Features

- IPFS CAR archive generator  
- Submission of papers with embedded reputation metadata  
- DAO proposal voting via native chainlet modules (archived)  
- User dashboard showcasing profiles, publications, and voting history  
- Chainlet node sync and integration monitoring tools

---
