# 🧠 DeSciBase

**DeSciBase** is a decentralized science publishing protocol that empowers researchers to publish, share, and monetize their work via blockchain and IPFS — governed by the community through $DSB and DAO.

---

## 🔹 Vision

To create an open, censorship-resistant and decentralized repository of scientific knowledge, free from gatekeepers, powered by token incentives and democratic governance.

---

## 🚀 Problem

Traditional scientific publishing is:

* Expensive and centralized  
* Opaque and slow  
* Difficult to access for the global public

---

## ✅ Solution

A decentralized protocol where:

* Researchers upload papers via IPFS  
* Pay small fee in $DSB to publish  
* Community curates and rewards content via likes and comments  
* All content is public, immutable and reputation-based

## 🪙 Tokenomics ($DSB)

| Category            | %   | Tokens     |
| ------------------- | --- | ---------- |
| DAO Treasury        | 40% | 40,000,000 |
| Ecosystem & Users   | 25% | 25,000,000 |
| Team                | 15% | 15,000,000 |
| Grants & Partners   | 10% | 10,000,000 |
| Liquidity & Staking | 10% | 10,000,000 |

Uses:

* Publish research (10 $DSB per paper)  
* Vote in DAO  
* Unlock premium access  
* Earn via engagement and curation

---

## 🧠 DAO Strategy

* Governance through $DSB token  
* On-chain or Snapshot voting  
* Proposals require 10k DSB or NFT badge  
* DAO manages treasury and early grants to authors

---

## 📊 Market

DeSci and decentralized knowledge protocols are growing:

* $30B+/year academic publishing industry  
* PhDs, students, indie researchers need alternatives  
* Ideal for DAO and token-based incentive models

---

## 🧪 MVP Features

* Submit papers (IPFS + contract)  
* Like/vote (on-chain or signed)  
* Personal profile (My Works, My Likes)  
* Community feed (New, Top, Most Liked)  
* Wallet login + $DSB payment system

---

## 💡 Roadmap (Q3–Q4 2025)

* ✅ MVP: IPFS + frontend + contract (Q3)  
* 🔄 DAO: Launch $DSB + voting system (Q4)  
* 🌐 Community: Author onboarding & grant pool  
* 📱 Mobile dApp & decentralized identity (Q4–Q1)

---

## 🤩 Tech Stack

* IPFS / Web3.Storage  
* Solidity / Pharos Chain  
* React + Tailwind (frontend)  
* DAO via Snapshot or on-chain module  
* $DSB ERC-20 token
