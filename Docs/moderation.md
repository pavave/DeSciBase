# 🧠 Moderation Framework for DeSciBase

DeSciBase ensures that all uploaded scientific articles are vetted for quality, structure, and integrity. Our moderation framework evolves through 4 stages — from AI-based moderation to full community-driven DAO governance.

---

## ✅ Stage 1 — AI-Based Moderation (MVP)

**Goal:** Launch quickly with reliable pseudoscience filtering using advanced LLMs.

**Tools:**
- GPT-4o or local models (SciBERT, Mistral, LLaMA3)
- CrossRef, arXiv, OpenAlex API integration
- Classification criteria:
  - IMRaD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion)
  - References with DOIs or arXiv IDs
  - Use of academic terminology
  - No clickbait or unverified claims

**Outcome:**  
Each article receives one of the following statuses:
- ✅ `scientific` – published automatically
- ⚠️ `suspicious` – flagged for manual/DAO review
- ❌ `non-scientific` – rejected

---

## 🧪 Stage 2 — Hybrid Moderation (AI + Manual Review)

**Goal:** Increase trust by involving human reviewers for edge cases.

**Process:**
- AI performs initial assessment
- Suspicious articles are forwarded to trusted reviewers
- Roles introduced via NFTs: `Reviewer`, `Editor`, `Curator`

**Outcome:**
- AI handles most articles
- Reviewers correct or validate borderline decisions
- Authors can request manual appeal

---

## 🧠 Stage 3 — DAO-Driven Moderation

**Goal:** Decentralize governance and incentivize community participation.

**Tools:**
- DAO governance (e.g., DAO DAO, Snapshot, custom Cosmos contracts)
- Reputation system or governance tokens ($DSB / NFTs)
- DAO votes to:
  - Approve suspicious articles
  - Request revision
  - Reject misleading content

**Outcome:**
- Self-governing moderation system
- Transparent, fair review process
- AI + DAO = scalable and trusted moderation

---

## 🚀 Stage 4 — Certification & Standards

**Goal:** Build long-term credibility and scientific trust.

**Features:**
- Verified peer reviewers
- Author reputation scores and certification
- Internal DeSciBase DOI for verified publications
- DAO-approved meta-journals and citation indexes

## 💡 Summary

| Stage      | Description                          | Role of AI      | Role of DAO    |
|------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Stage 1    | AI-only filtering                    | 🧠 Core          | ❌ Not used     |
| Stage 2    | AI + manual fallback                 | 🧠 Primary       | ✅ Optional     |
| Stage 3    | Full DAO governance                  | 🧠 Pre-screening | 🗳️ Main engine  |
| Stage 4    | Global credibility, certification    | 🧠+🔍 Quality aid | 🏛 Final authority |
