# DeSciBase Whitepaper

## Introduction

**DeSciBase** is a decentralized platform for publishing, storing, and evaluating scientific research.  
By leveraging blockchain, IPFS/Filecoin, and custom appchain infrastructure (Saga chainlet), it provides an open, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional academic publishing â€” with built-in incentives and community governance.

## Problem Statement

Traditional scientific publishing is centralized, expensive, and subject to gatekeeping or censorship.  
Open access and data immutability remain largely unsolved, especially in legacy systems controlled by a few major publishers.  
Researchers also lack transparency, fast feedback loops, and global visibility.

## Solution Overview

DeSciBase offers:

- Immutable publication of research papers using blockchain
- IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized file storage
- Like-based social signaling to surface impactful research
- On-chain comment system and discussion layer (planned)
- DAO-based governance for community moderation and funding
- Native chainlet modules for tokenomics, reputation, and IPFS registry (via Saga)

## Architecture

- **Chainlet:** Saga-based blockchain with modular runtime (Cosmos SDK)
- **Modules:** `desciToken`, `reputation`, `dao`, `ipfs`
- **IPFS/Filecoin:** Persistent storage of CAR-archived publications
- **Frontend:** Web3-enabled React app (wallet auth, upload, browse)
- **DAO:** Weighted voting based on token balance + reputation score

## Chainlet Evolution

To overcome the limitations of smart contracts and maximize decentralization,  
DeSciBase is migrating toward a native chainlet powered by [Saga](https://www.saga.xyz).

This appchain architecture allows:
- Direct runtime-level governance and scoring
- Faster logic execution than EVM
- IPFS hash anchoring on-chain
- Upgradeable modules for tokenomics and moderation

Chainlet source and roadmap: [`/saga`](https://github.com/pavave/DeSciBase/tree/main/saga)

## Tokenomics

- **Token:** $DSB (DeSciBase Token) â€” launched via chainlet governance
- **Utilities:**
  - Voting on DAO proposals
  - Rewarding active users, reviewers, and curators
  - Visibility boosting and reputation tracking
- **Distribution (tentative):**
  - Community & Contributors: 60%
  - Reserve & Treasury: 20%
  - Grants & Ecosystem: 10%
  - Team: 10%
