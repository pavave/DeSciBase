# DeSciBase Whitepaper 

## Introduction

DeSciBase aims to revolutionize scientific publishing by providing a decentralized, censorship-resistant platform built on blockchain and IPFS technologies. Our system ensures immutability, transparency, and community-driven governance.

## Problem Statement

Traditional scientific publishing is centralized, often costly, and subject to censorship or manipulation. Data immutability and open access remain challenges.

## Solution Overview

DeSciBase enables authors to publish papers as immutable records on the blockchain, with PDF files stored on IPFS. Community members can interact via likes, comments, and participate in decentralized governance through a native token.

## Architecture

- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts for publication management, likes, and governance  
- **IPFS:** Distributed storage of research papers  
- **Frontend:** User interface for publication, browsing, and interaction  
- **DAO:** Token-based governance system for platform decisions

## Tokenomics

- Token: $DSB (DeSciBase Token)  
- Incentives for authors, reviewers, and active community members  
- Token utility: publishing fees, voting rights, premium features access
