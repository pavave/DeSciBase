# DeSciBase Whitepaper

## Introduction

**DeSciBase** is a decentralized platform for publishing, storing, and evaluating scientific research. By leveraging blockchain and IPFS/Filecoin, it provides an open, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional academic publishing â€” with built-in incentives and community governance.

## Problem Statement

Traditional scientific publishing is centralized, expensive, and subject to gatekeeping or censorship. Open access and data immutability remain largely unsolved, especially in legacy systems controlled by a few major publishers. Researchers also lack transparency, fast feedback loops, and global visibility.

## Solution Overview

DeSciBase offers:

- Immutable publication of research papers using blockchain
- IPFS/Filecoin for decentralized file storage
- Like-based social signaling to surface impactful research
- On-chain comment system and discussion layer (planned)
- DAO-based governance for community moderation and funding

## Architecture

- **Blockchain:** Smart contracts to handle paper submissions, likes, and governance
- **IPFS/Filecoin:** Persistent storage of PDF publications
- **Frontend:** Web3-enabled React app (wallet auth, upload, browse)
- **DAO:** Token-based voting and community moderation system

## Tokenomics

- **Token:** $DSB (DeSciBase Token) â€” to be launched in governance phase
- **Utilities:**
  - Voting on DAO proposals
  - Rewarding active users, moderators, and early authors
  - Optional access to featured visibility and analytics
- **Distribution (tentative):**
  - Community & Contributors: 60%
  - Reserve & Treasury: 20%
  - Grants & Ecosystem: 10%
  - Team: 10%
