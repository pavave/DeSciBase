# ⚛️ Saga Chainlet — Infrastructure for Decentralized Science

This directory contains the architecture, roadmap, and future module logic for launching a dedicated Saga chainlet as part of the DeSciBase ecosystem.

🎯 **Goal:**  
To build an independent, modular blockchain focused on decentralized scientific collaboration, publishing, and governance — fully powered by a Saga chainlet.

---

## 🔧 Modules (planned)

- `token/` – Native token module (e.g. `desciCoin`) with customizable supply and utility logic
- `reputation/` – Reputation system based on on-chain actions like publishing and reviewing
- `dao/` – Voting framework with adjustable weights (token + reputation)
- `ipfs/` – Module for registering CAR file hashes and metadata of publications

> Each module will be designed using Cosmos SDK or Saga templates and integrated into the chainlet runtime.

## 📈 Roadmap

See [`roadmap.md`](./roadmap.md) for implementation phases, from initialization to public testnet launch.
