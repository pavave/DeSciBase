# Grant Proposal: DeSciBase â€” Decentralized Science Registry

## Overview

DeSciBase is a decentralized platform for publishing, storing, and evaluating scientific research using blockchain and IPFS/Filecoin. It aims to build a censorship-resistant, trustless archive for global scientific knowledge, governed by the community through DAO mechanisms.

## What Makes DeSciBase Unique

- IPFS-based scientific publication storage with blockchain-backed verification
- DOI metadata linking and decentralized citation tracking
- Social layer for science (likes, comments, profiles)
- Token Curated Registry (TCR) for DAO-based moderation
- Modular and chain-agnostic frontend + backend architecture

## Roadmap (Chain-Agnostic)

| Phase | Deliverables |
|-------|--------------|
| MVP   | Uploading papers to IPFS, blockchain publishing, likes |
| Phase 2 | On-chain comments, profiles, DAO moderation |
| Phase 3 | Citation indexing, integration with arXiv, Crossref, Zenodo |
| Phase 4 | Multichain deployment and institutional adoption |

## Requested Grant

**$400,000 USD**

### Budget Breakdown

| Category | Description | Amount |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Equipment | Upgrade 5â€“10 dev workstations | $45,000 |
| Dev Salaries | Contract devs, frontend/backend, integrators | $180,000 |
| Community | Outreach, social growth, onboarding | $50,000 |
| Research | DOI integration, open science support | $40,000 |
| Security | Audits and test coverage | $30,000 |
| Infrastructure | Servers, IPFS pinning, tooling | $25,000 |
| Coordination | PMs, QA, community managers | $30,000 |
