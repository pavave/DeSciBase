# Grant Proposal: DeSciBase – Decentralized Scientific Publishing

## Project Summary

**DeSciBase** is a decentralized platform for storing, verifying, and indexing scientific research. By integrating IPFS for decentralized storage and CosmWasm-based smart contracts for transparent on-chain verification, DeSciBase brings open science into the Web3 era — censorship-resistant, immutable, and governed by a decentralized community.

We aim to launch DeSciBase as a fully operational dApp on a Cosmos-based network, enabling scientists and institutions to publish, verify, and curate research openly and transparently.

## Key Features

- ✅ Decentralized storage via IPFS (papers, metadata, versions)
- 🔗 DOI and metadata enrichment (Crossref, arXiv, Zenodo)
- 👤 Web3 login via Keplr / Leap (IBC-compatible wallets)
- 📚 Smart contract–based publication registry (CosmWasm)
- 🧠 DAO moderation through token-curated registries (TCRs)
- 🔍 On-chain search and citation graph (planned)

## Grant Request

We are requesting **$400,000** in funding to build, audit, and launch the first fully operational version of DeSciBase and engage scientific communities across the world.

| 🧰 Infrastructure | IPFS pinning, indexer, CI/CD, hosting                | $25,000    |
| 🛠 Hardware      | Dev machines (PCs, laptops for 5–10 contributors)     | $45,000    |
| 🧩 Team Ops      | Hiring, management, coordination                      | $30,000    |

> *All software will be released as open source under the MIT/Apache license.*

## Timeline

**3–6 months**, depending on engagement from scientific and Web3 institutions.

| Phase | Deliverables | Duration |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Contracts, IPFS, testnet demo | Month 1–2 |
| Phase 2 | Full frontend + Web3 login    | Month 2–3 |
| Phase 3 | Audit, bug bounties, feedback | Month 4   |
| Phase 4 | DAO prototype + mainnet launch | Month 5–6 |

## Expected Outcomes

- 🧪 Working MVP deployed on testnet and mainnet
- 🔗 Verified research papers published and registered
- 👥 Onboarded Web3 researchers, reviewers, early DAOs
- 🧬 Initial DAO moderation framework deployed
- 🔍 CID-based search, metadata linkages to DOI systems

## Long-term Vision

- 🔬 Decentralized citation graph
- 🧾 Proof-of-Review and Open Peer Review mechanisms
- 🏛 Institutional onboarding (labs, universities, DAOs)
- 🧠 Reputation systems for researchers and reviewers
