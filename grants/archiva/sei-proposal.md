# Grant Proposal: DeSciBase on Sei

## Project Summary

DeSciBase is a decentralized science registry built to store, verify, and evaluate scientific research using IPFS and blockchain technology. This grant will fund the deployment of DeSciBase on the Sei Network via CosmWasm, utilizing Sei’s parallel execution and composable infrastructure for scalable on-chain publication workflows.

## Key Features

- IPFS CID registration on Sei for scientific papers
- DOI and metadata linking (Crossref, arXiv, Zenodo)
- Web3 login with Keplr/Leap (Sei wallet support)
- DAO moderation through Token Curated Registries (planned)
- Open source, verifiable scientific archive

## Grant Use Case

This proposal requests $400,000 to port DeSciBase to Sei and grow the scientific Web3 user base through institutional and public use cases.

### Budget Allocation

| Category | Description | Amount |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Hardware | Developer PC upgrades (5–10) | $45,000 |
| Dev Work | CosmWasm contracts + frontend | $180,000 |
| Adoption | Scientific user onboarding | $50,000 |
| Research | Open science integration (DOI, metadata) | $40,000 |
| Audit | Code and contract auditing | $30,000 |
| Ops | Infra, CI/CD, docs | $25,000 |
| Mgmt | Hiring, team lead, coordination | $30,000 |

## Timeline

**3–6 months**, depending on team scale and institutional engagement.

## Outcomes

- MVP deployed on Sei Testnet + Mainnet
- Institutional pilot with IPFS + Sei CID registration
- DAO moderation design phase
