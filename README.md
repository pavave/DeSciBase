# DeSciBase â€” Decentralized Science Publication Registry

DeSciBase is a decentralized platform for publishing, storing, and evaluating scientific research using blockchain and IPFS technology.  
Our goal is to create an open, censorship-resistant, and community-driven ecosystem for scientific knowledge sharing.

## Features

- Decentralized publication of scientific papers  
- IPFS integration for file storage  
- Social features: likes and (planned) comments  
- Token-based incentives and governance (planned)  
- Web3 wallet integration for user authentication and transactions

## Tech Stack

- Smart Contracts (Solidity or Move)  
- React + Vite frontend  
- IPFS (via Pinata) for file storage  
- ethers.js for blockchain interaction

## How to run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Setup `.env` file with contract address and Pinata API keys  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
4. Run frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
5. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
   
## Roadmap

MVP smart contracts for publishing and liking papers

Frontend with IPFS upload and wallet integration

On-chain comments and moderation tools

DAO governance and tokenomics implementation

Security audit and documentation
