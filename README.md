# 🧠 DeSciBase — Decentralized Science Publication Registry

**DeSciBase** is a decentralized platform for publishing, storing, and evaluating scientific research using blockchain and IPFS technology.  
Our goal is to create an open, censorship-resistant, and community-driven ecosystem for scientific knowledge sharing.
